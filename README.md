#Webpage Frontend Refactor
<br/>
##Description
<br/>
This is a refactor of an existing website with the goal of improving its accessibility and search engine optimization. The website was originally created with outdated HTML and CSS, so the refactor updates the code to use modern best practices.
<br/>
Examples of these improvements include:
- replacing excessive use of &lt;div&gt; elements with appropriate semantic elements
- addition of descriptive alt texts for all &lt;img&gt; elements on the page
- updating header hierarchy to align with informational hierarchy
<br/>
Appropriate updates were made to corresponding CSS to ensure styling remained consistent after HTML refactor.
